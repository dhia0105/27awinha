wget https://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/maven/maven-3/3.6.3/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz
tar -xvf apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz

also :
M2_HOME='/opt/apache-maven-3.6.3'
PATH="$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export PATH

# check installation and version
mvn --version
# i read that you can use gradle but maven is only used for pure java projects and for maven is used for small projects like this one
