I first steps:
1 - Main page
2 - login page
with android studio, xml, java
login page communicate with need a server side app serving endpoints one of them is for autentification with jwt
3 - server. aka. backend: with java springboot : hesitant between graphql api or rest api
4 - mongo db database
Some key point:
++++The point of sharing the users location is important for filtering fake info
++++ To write an info about the bus location you need to login.
++++ To view or rate an info/member you do not need to create a profil
*** not sure yet if the old info should be saved or no in the begining, maybe saving the user rating is enough in the begining
$$$$$ the architecture and the tech stack are kind of clear for now $$$$$
Points to work on for next steps:
have a clear idea about the user experience, start having a look on spring boot and consuming apis from the front app side with java
also check java coding best practices is important
