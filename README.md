# 27awinha
A repository to help us find a lost bus in our district (based on community participation)
27 A is bus in district of elghazella (ariana,Tunisia) it exists in the papers but not anymore in real life.
This app is to help the resident of the cite elghazelle know where this bus is exactly. If it happened that someone have seen it in the street, he/she reports it to the app . Then the history of this realtime data appears for everyone in the app. 
Unfortunately, we do not having bus tracking systems implemented in the buses for a reason or another. So instead of jsut accepting this weird decision of the govermement, why not we start testing the maturity of the community.
This app can scale to track every bus/tram position in tunisia. And if anyone has a taken a bus he reports the bus position, this would help other people who are waiting for the same bus to take the decision if they are going to wait for it or to continue their journey with another utility.
ps: i am a 26 old guy that waisted almost 1 year of his life waiting for buses that never came. ðŸ˜ž
